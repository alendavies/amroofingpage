Most charge lots of money up front and they do subpar work. When AM Roofing came out to my place their prices was very satisfactory and they did not ask for any money up front to begin the job. I was a little hesitant because of this but I could not beat their prices and decided to give them the job. They did an amazing job and I would recommend them to any one who is looking for superior work and may have the same concerns that I had. Thank you AM Roofing for making me smile and for saving me tons of money."',
